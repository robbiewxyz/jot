##### Chromium new tab page extension

Simple, bulletproof, new tab page for your thoughts.  Your new tab page becomes a persistent scratchpad for you to fill with whatever comes to mind:

- TODO lists, grocery lists, part lists
- Stuff to remember, anything
- Venting your frustration (it happens sometimes!)
- Calculations, puzzles, et cetera
- Whatever else!  Ascii art!  Flow charts!  Schedules!


Enough with these "widget" thingies filling our tabs.  Now you're limited only by your imagination and Unicode's 1,112,064 characters!

#### CONTRIBUTIONS ARE *SO* WELCOME!
